       An entangled machine shares a tape, but has an independent head. Returns the new
       machine. See also #'with-mk-entangled which provides an entangled machine with
       limited scope (that is commonly what is needed).

      "Like mk-entangled, but we recycle the tm-to-be-recycled machine rather than
       creating a new instance. Typically this is used to keep the tm-to-be-recycled
       machine reference valid while walking across a collection of machines.  E.g. it is
       used in this manner in nd-tm-subspace.lisp. Though unnecessary, as we will already
       have a reference to tm-to-be-recycled, it is returned.  This keeps the
       recycled-entangled from consistent with the mk-entangled form.
