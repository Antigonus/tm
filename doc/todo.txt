4. need to write mn and m* as repeating m is very inefficient

7. right now tm-difference-engine is only linear, need to finish implementation
   tm-line -> tm-difference-engine

8. for tm-mk we should key an array (or list) of functions, then upon each hook of the
   same key, we push another function on the array.  Upon call we pull the array, call the
   first function, if it fails the second, etc. only failing when there are no more
   functions in the array.

   This way code can add to the make functions for a given type.  This is important
   as new init types, including user defined init types, will need to be added later.
