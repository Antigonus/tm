1. nix the current #'so in favor of keeping the list tm as the tape
for the tree tm, thus it keeps its type, and #s can be called on it.
#'so can then take the meaning of step out, the inverse operation to
#'si.

2. define conversions from tapes to sequences.  Right now directly
using tape accessor which is not, and probably should not be, exported
on the package interface.

3. ⟳ should be replaced with ⟳-work, then the -work can be dropped.

4. need to write mn and m* as repeating m is very inefficient
