4. need to write mn and m* as repeating m is very inefficient

7. right now tm-difference-engine is only linear, need to finish implementation
   tm-line -> tm-difference-engine

10. should modify #'L, i.e. {},  to recognize repeated symbols and only evaluate
    them once.  This could be done by wrapping the current #'L with a let.

    also nested brackets should return a nested list instead of quoting the
    bracket operator
       currently->  [1 2 [3 4]] ->  (1 2 (q 3 4))
         want-> [1 2 [3 4]]  -> (1 2 (3 4))

     braces will do this  {1 2 {3 4}} -> {1 2 {3 4}}, but they evaluate

11. need to add name spaces for test-hook, and then have (test-all) run everything
independent of the names space, and (test-all 'space) to run only the given name
space
