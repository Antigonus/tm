1. nix the current #'so in favor of keeping the list tm as the tape for the tree tm, thus
it keeps its type, and #s can be called on it.  #'so can then take the meaning of step
out, the inverse operation to #'si.

2.
it is now in the tm-mk file and list specialization, but more needs to be implemented

    define conversions from tapes to sequences.  Right now directly using tape accessor
    which is not, and probably should not be, exported on the package interface.


4. need to write mn and m* as repeating m is very inefficient

5. unicode defines both inc and delta,  we have used inc,  we need
 to undo that and move everything to delta.

6. currently we have (tm-mk 'tag init)  where tag can be either a type
we are to make a machine from, or the type of machine to be made, but
these are incompatible.  Multiple machines can be made from a given type.
Make tag be type of machine only,  and when it is null, we look at the
type of init and make a determination as to what type of machine to make.
