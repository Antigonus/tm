tm-print will only work on machines that we can entangle with, so nd-tape-machine
is the most primitive option.

when we want to emphasize that structural operations are not allowed, nd-tape-machine

if we want to have the ability to make entangled copies, and have destructive operations,
then ea-tape-machine with a base-type that implements a haz-tape-machine.

if we would have chosen solo-tape-machine, but we need to tm-print (or perform any
function that does not keep a copy, but only makes an entangled copy, works while
performing no destructive operations, and then returns, within a single thread) then
haz-tape-machine.

If you don't need entanglement accounting, but the machine must have the ability
to be empty, status-tape-machine.

if the machine is used across threads - a ts1-tape-machine.

If you don't know, and in a single threaded environment, ea-tape-machine.
