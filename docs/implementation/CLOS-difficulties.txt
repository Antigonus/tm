1. personality of an object, say 'X' type, is lost when it is inherited into a class,
hence one can not acces methods for working on the 'X' part of an object.  The solution
has been to use a slot for holding parent types instead of using inheritance.  The
object in the slot maintains its type.

2. call next method only works when that method has the same name, and only one next
method is needed. Not possible are simple co-routine relationships,  where say,  x->y
and y->x   (child to parent).

3. defgeneric does not allow the definition of optional values on arguments that are
common to all methods.  We can get around this by having a function, say f, with optional
argument defaults defined, that then in turn calls a generic, say f-0.

4. dispatch is only on the class type of the argument.  Many people have noted that
general popositions related to type would be useful.  Here we want dispatch based on
the value of a state variable.  To force this to happen, we use type to hold the state
value.  (type-of state) : one of 'void 'parked 'active.  

5. aliasing of interface function names across classes of different types, but can
only have one type signature.  So we a function called 'empty'  for tape
machines.  It calls empty-0 while adding (state tm), as per points 3 and 4 above.
In addition we have a buffers stack and queue.  It is natural to ask if the buffer
is empty with, say,  (empty buff0),  but as buffers do not have state, and thus goes to
a funciton to supply the optional defaults, it will fail when (state buff0) is called.
In general we might want widly different argument lists for a method with the same
name that is disptached from different class types, but CLOS won't let us.

6. two siblings both want to have a new generic function with the same name and signature.
there is no-where to put the declaration.  If I put it in the parent, then the parent
is responsible for knowing what will be implemented in children.  I don't like this
as only parent stuff belongs in the parent.  If I put the declaration in one of the
children, but not the other, then it appars to be missing in the other file.  I have
to go hunting for it ...   this is related to the aliasing problem - if it were not for
aliasing I could just declare it in both children.

7. Want to test the generic interface implementation though we have a more specific
list implemenation.  Currently we have no other implementations, and we need at least
one real implementation for a test to run.  There appears no way short of tearing into
CLOS to tell it to use the generic interface version.

8. another example where calling the parent (more general) methods would be useful, but we
can't.  In ts1 we simply add a lock to the more general ea version.  Inside the method
'clean-entanglements' calls are made to simpler interface routines.  When these call back
into ts1, they attempt to set the lock again.  Hence we have had to use a recusive lock.
If instead we could tell CLOS to do parent function work inside the parent function then
we would not need the recursive lock.  This could be done in two ways, either when we call
next method, we tell close to treat the type as the more general type, everywhere.  Or
secondly, we could reproduce 'clean-entanglements' and inside it explicitly make calls
to the more general function versions (something we can not do now).
