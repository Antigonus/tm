how management works


event station
1. associate lambdas with events
    1. same thread or separate thread option

2. receive event / turn event on or off
    0. transient event, trips whatever is already waiting if anything, then disappears
    1. single event consumed when lambad fired
    2. event counted, and counted decremented when event is consumed
    3. event toggled with set and clear
    4. event forever (such as the 'even-station-open' event

an event is list, the head of the list is a symbol


manager services: 

1. make managed machine

   make given machine type, like mk
   Upon a request to allocate, the manager provides a satellite machine.  mtm managed tape
    machine.

   make new machine, or make entangled machine

   entanglement list uses weak pointers cleaned up by finalizers

2. keeps address of head - an integer
3. collision detection
4. tape machine status
    - adds continuations for status changes

    abandoned
    locked
    empty
    active
    



If we put all associated state in tape machine so that deallocation becomes unnecessary.
The shared mentanglements list uses weak pointers with finalizers.
