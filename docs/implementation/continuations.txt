convention has evolved a lot.

now using a symbol, mainly due to passing lambadas as predicates into quantifiers called
for a denser notation.

Design guideline, when writing a function focus on the needs of that function.

  Here was an issue with that guideline: Say inside a function we call another function
  and that particular specialization needs a continuation on that sub-function.  So it
  would appear that we should always pass the continuation list along.

  However, if we always pass the continuation list along, we don't know how many
  levels deep until it is used. By that time it may have lost its meaning.

  So, if an outer function needs a continuation for a specialized type due only
  to an inner function needing, then that function needs to have a specialized
  version for the specialzed type.

  Then we keep the convention of focusing on the needs of a function for the
  type of arguments it is passed.

  There are some functions which are merely wrappers to another function, somehow
  tailoring its reponse in some small way. In which case the sub-function is driving the
  boat, and it should receive the continuation list.
