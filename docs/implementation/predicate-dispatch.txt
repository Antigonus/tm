predicate dispatch would simplify the code a lot.  For example, bound-left singelton and
bound-right all play together.  I emulated predicate dispatch with an inheritance
hierarchy.  That worked, but it was upside down from how people think about it.

nice article on the topic of predicate disptaching

This is interesting.  Passes in another variable just for purposes of choosing the
interface.

Haven't been able to find any libraries so ...


I will emulate disjunction by specifying multiple typed functions with different
signatures that all call the same untyped function.

I will emulate conjunction by using a typep cond inside the code.  Alternatively
I could call typed sub-functions from the first term function.
