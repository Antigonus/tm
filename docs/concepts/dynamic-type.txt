I've not really thought much about dynamic type before getting into CLOS.

The fact is that dynamic type information is data.  It has to be put somewhere.
Dynamic type is largely operated on behind the scenes.   In this case by CLOS
dispatch, though if one wants one can open that box.

Seems to me it would be better to give the programmer operations to directly operate on this
place where type is held, whether it is memory mapped type, an entry in a symbol table, or
unseen header on instances.
