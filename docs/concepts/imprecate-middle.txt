1. imprecate middle and regression

  test routines say:

  * (test-all)
  all 0 passed
  T


  .. 0 failed, 0 passed

  Nothing failed, so nothing is holding us back, so regression passed.

  perhpas:

  * (test-all)
  0 failed
  regression passes

  But we can also say..
  Nothing passed, so regression did not pass. 

  We can appeal to a higher level analysis ..  Having no tests means we
  did not do regression.  It can not pass or fail,  however the testing
  methodology did fail -- as a good methodology needs regression.

2. quantifiers

  would like ramification on quantifiers for not true / not false cases

  for existential quantification, if the set is empty, then existence failed.
  all other quantifications follow

  all == no case exists where pred is false

  set is empty,  so no case exists.  No case exists where pred it true,
  none exists where it is false.  so universal quantification is true for
  an empty set.


3.  another interesting case

   Is on-bound-right true for an empty machine?

   on-bound-right is short for 'on bound-right cell' but the machine is not on
   a cell. So on-bound-right is false.

   step has only two responses,  ➜ok,  or ➜bound-right, we can't step, so
   on-bound-right is true.

   Perhaps ➜bound-right and on-bound-right should be renamed, perhaps to
   ➜cant-step  and cant-step or some such.  Perhaps step should have
   another continuation -- actually it already does, 'accessing-empty'.

   Also note this issues relates to the quantiers, and their impricate cases.
