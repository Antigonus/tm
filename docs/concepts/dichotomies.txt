Primitive functions are those that a new tape machine interface must define.  This is as
opposed to derived functions, for which the library derives from the primitives. A new
tape machine may provide implementations for derived functions out of logical need or
due to performance issues.

There is no functional need for a new tape machine implementation to specialize derived
functions.  Though some machines may specialize them for performance reasons.
