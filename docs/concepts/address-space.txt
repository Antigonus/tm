The neighbor topology on the tape provides for a mapping between cells and natural
numbers.  This follows simply from the Peano axioms.  We call such natural numbers
addresses.

When we use a tape array as a tape, as per tm-array, then this mapping is automatic.  The array
indexes are our tape addreses.

Topology modifying operations then are of two types.  Those that modify the address space and
thus invalidate old addresses, and those which do not.  Our only topology modify that does not
perturb the address space is that of append.

If a user wants to preserve the address space, and still allow insertion of new cells on the tape,
the user may put the insertions into subspaces.  Though, then, sub-space addressing of the form
xxx.yy  will be needed to locate cells in the subspace (here xxx is an address on the main tape,
and yy is an address in the subspace).  This then becomes recursive.

But this begs the question as to how to preserve the address space when prepending to the tape.
Perhaps the leading digit would then be âˆ….
