1. Machines that share a tape are said to be 'entangled'.  A solo machine, one that solely
   owns its tape, will never be entangled.

2. To perform 'entanglement accounting' means to keep a set or references to entangled
   machines, and then to check this set so as to guarantee the integrity of entangled
   machines.

3. These are the situations where entanglemnt accounting is needed to assure the integrity
   of non-solo machines:

  3.1
    When a new cell is allocated to the left of the tape, all entangled machines are sent a
    message so that they may update their tape reference.

  3.2
    When a cell is deallocated from the left of a tape, all entangled machines are sent a
    message, so that they may update their tape reference.

  3.3
    A collision occurs if one machine attempts to deallocate a cell for which an entangled
    machine has its head on.

    Collisions can only occur between active machines.

  3.4
   (let( (tm-new  (fork tm-orig))))

    When a machine is forked, the newly forked machine must be added to then entanglement
    list of the tm-orig machine.

  3.4
    (cue-to tm-cued tm-orig)

    the tm-cued machine must be disentangled with itself, and then entangled with the
    tm-orig machine.

  3.5
    forcing a state change (for the boundary calculus) 

    3.5.1 
    to 'abandoned', as part of the operation for abandoning is to disentagle the
    machine

    3.5.2
    to 'void' as voiding one machine must cause all entangled machines to become
    void.


4. Notice that all the situations where entanglment accounting is required entail
   either deallocation of cells, or allocation of a new leftmost cell.

   In a single threaded version,  or where a single thread is guaranteed due to
   locks, and there is neither deallocation, nor allocation of leftmost, entanglement
   accounting is not needed.

   In the multithreaded case, if it were not for entanglement accounting, deallocation in
   one thread, could destroy the integrity of a machine in another thread - even though
   that other thread has no situations where entanglement accounting is necessary.

5. We can now define 'non-destructive'  programming, as a programming style that neither
   allocates new leftmost cells, nor deallocates cells, and this is true for all threads
   of execution.  Entanglement accounting is not needed for non-destructive programming.
