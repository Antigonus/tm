If for predicates we include in a continations list ➜t and ➜∅, rather than just putting
them directly as parameters, that implies there are more possiblities.  This is attractive
as we can have abstract tape machines.  It may be that a comparison is done between
things for which no relative ordering exists, or some such.  We also have a real time
problem, so perhaps a comparision result would be temporal, like not-yet.

However, our library makes use of predicates.  If a predicate doesn't run either the
true or false continuation, something might break.  We would need a redesign.

For example, ∃ calls a predicate.  How does it handle a multivalued logic result?
