        <h1> Unicode </h1>

        <p>
          For your convenience there is a file "emacs-keys" in the docs directory of the
          distribution which sets the C-x g &lt name &gt SPC to enter the characters used
          in the library.  Here 'name' is a nickname. I would have preferred being able to
          define my own nicknames and to modify the existing C-x 8 so that such a nickname
          followed by a space would enter a character, but when delving into the emacs
          library I found it to be rather 'Unicode technical'.

        <p>
          So to type the character capital delta when emacs-keys is loaded, type C-x
          g D SPC. Actually Δ occurs twice in Unicode, once as capital delta, and once as
          a symbol for 'increment' in mathematics.  We consider the increment version
          to only be there for typography purposes.  We only use capital delta, even
          when it is for an increment variable.

        <p>
          I've limited the use of Unicode to things that 'probably would have been this
          way had Unicode been around before', are conventional notation, and to a couple
          of symbol extensions that were needed to facilitate the access language and
          looping.

        <p> In the file src-1/fundamental.lisp find synonym bindings for the usual
          operators ∧, ∨, ≥, ≤, λ, ∅, etc.  

        <p>
          There are three characters used in the library for which there are currently no
          synonyms.  We use the character '◧' as shorthand for 'leftmost'.  This is
          because it looks like a little tape with the inked over cell being the leftmost
          cell. In the same manner the character '◨' is shorthand for rightmost. 

          These symbols are used on the single name access langauge functions as
          modifiers meaning to operate on rightmost or leftmost rather than the cell
          the head is on, or, to specify contracts with the programmer of the sort: "this
          function is only called when the cell is on rightmost."

          As we had symbols for leftmost and rightmost I also started using them generally
          to mean leftmost or rightmost wherever that was convenient.  For example,
          to shorten up the names of continuations so that argument lists would fit
          on a line.

        <p>
          As a third symbol I introduced, ⟳ for 'do'.  Initially this was because all of
          the loop words were already used, but it turns out to work nicely because the
          first argument is often a function that steps, so it looks like a modifier
          meaning repeat stepping, and in fact that is what it is.
