      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>
        This is a formalized iteratation library for Common Lisp.

      <p>
        The tape machine may be used to access and traverse through the objects in a
        container.  Loop constructs follow naturally as quanitification operations on
        containers.  Unlike for the standard library loop structure, after exiting a loop,
        the unprocessed parts of lists are still accessible.  Unlike for stream libraries,
        the tape machine has random access capabilities between continuation limits.

      <p>
        By the term <i>formalized</i> I mean that the iteration model is constructed from
        formal concepts, most that have been well studied in computation theory. Basically
        the tape machine is a hybrid between a Turing Machine and a Lambda Calculus, with
        the Turing machine used for iteration in a limited region, and then invoking
        continuation functions, lambdas, for extending bounds.  I make the claim that
        there are no library architectural limitations for working with arbitrary long
        containers.

      <p>
        If for no other reason, the formal derivation is useful because it guides the
        terminology.  As it turns out, there is an explosion in the number of end cases
        when dealing with containers.  Our formalism provides a language for talking
        about them.

      <p>
        This library is part of a scalable memory management approach, one which has
        been left for release when I get another opportunity to spend some time on
        this.

      <h1>Basic Concepts</h1>

      <p>
        In Pascal's calculator and Babbage's computer the alignment between one of the
        imprinted digit values encircling a gear and an index needle was said to indicate the value of
        a digit.  Then an array of such gears and index pointers were said to indicate the
        values of the multiple digits that made up a number.  

      <p>
        Contemporary computers create an abstraction in an analogous manner, where a more
        than threshold amount of charge existing in a memory cell is said to indicate
        a <i>one</i> and a less than threshold amount is said to indicate a <i>zero</i>,
        thus indicating the value of a single binary digit, or bit.  Bits are then arrayed
        to create words, which typically represent integers.

      <p>
        At the next abstraction level up words are then arrayed.  An address decoder is
        placed on top of such an array.  An address decoder is a circuit that creates a
        correspondence between an input word called the <i>address</i>, and the location
        of another word in the array.  In this manner the address decoder gives our
        container topological properties such neighboring words, and ordering among
        words. Note that in this context a word is an allocation unit, not a value.  We
        address memory cells, not the data in them.  Thus such a container forms a sort of
        fabric, which we abstract into the concept of address space.

      <p>
        The prior two paragraphs summarize my partially complete "Memory Book" which may
        be found on my website.  The take away here is that the interface between
        computation and information is the address space, so address spaces are of
        fundamental importance. In mathematics the fundamental address space is the set, in
        computing it depends on the language used.  In the C language, all pointers can
        be interpreted as arrays of objects that have a given type (a given layout in
        memory, a given format) simply by applying the [Â·] operator.  Lisp is also built
        upon a fundamental container type, the <i>list</i>, with access through <i>car</i>
        and <i>cdr</i>. 

      <p>
        Lisp programmers came to realize that containers of differing implementations have
        similar properties, and thus could be used through a common interface.  They now
        speak of <i>sequences</i> instead of lists, where a sequence can be either an
        array or a list.  C++ programmers came to a similar realization, and with the
        advent of the Standard Template Library, pointers evolved to general iterators.
        Once incremented, a pointer points to the next element in an array, and once
        incremented, an iterator points to the next member of the STL container.

      <p>
        However, the distillation of computing to that of the processing of data in
        sequence predates C, Lisp, and Fortran for that matter.  The Turing Machine is an
        abstraction of a computing machine built from a state controller, a read-write
        head, and a tape.  The tape is a memory constructed of a array of cells.  The head
        can be moved to a neighbor cell, no differently than moving a pointer or an
        iterator using the '++' and '--' operator.  Though there is a salient difference
        between these paradigms in that the Turing Machine has been formalized.

      <p>
        In <i>Elements of the Theory of Computation</i> Christos Papdimitriou builds
        computation theory up from founding assumptions, while characterizing successively
        more powerful computing paradigms, arriving finally at the Turing Machine. The
        Turing Machine has limitations, such as not being able be used to solve
        the <i>halting problem</i>, but he can not identifiy a stronger computing
        paradigm.  In a dual approach Lambda Calculus can be used to establish the same
        theorems.  What we know from these formalisms is that all Turing Complete
        computing approaches employ a potentially open series of finite computations,
        performed over a potentially unbounded memory, where that memory need only have
        one topological property, that of a every cell, save one, having two distinct
        neighbors.  (It can be held that an exceptional cell is a start cell, and has only
        one neighbor.)

      <p>
        Presented in this library is a container type based on the Turing Machine
        abstraction.  Though the container is bounded, upon striking a bound a
        continuation function is executed, and that continuation function may over come
        the bound, or perhaps take some other actions. We call our container a <i>tape
        machine</i>, and often abbreviate it as <i>tm</i>. For example, to step an
        iterator, one calls the function #'s and passes it a tape machine instance and two
        functions.  Here the two functions are called <i>cont-ok</i>
        and <i>cont-rightmost</i>:

      <pre>
        <code>
          (s tm cont-ok cont-rightmost)
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        The function name, #'s, stands for 'step'.  The tape machine, <i>tm</i>, is a
        combination of iterator and container, and #'s causes the internal iterator to
        step.  This is analogous to the container being a Turing Machine tape, the internal
        iterator a tape head, and the program, which is external to our container,
        providing the control.  The concept of state is more complicated.  To the extent
        that the external program does not keep state, state is encompassed by the
        location of the internal iterator in the container, and the values held in the
        container.

      <p>
        Note that <i>cont-ok</i> Stands for "continue OK", while <i>cont-rightmost</i>
        stands for "continue from rightmost".  At any point in time our container will
        typically have a bounded size.  When this bound is struck, we call <i>cont-rightmost</i>
        so that the program has an opportunity to overcome this bound, and implement
        Turing Complete behavior.

        <pre>
          <code>
            (s tm
              (Î»()(print "everything went well"))
              (Î»()(print "go get more data!"))
            )
          </code>
        </pre>

      <p>
        Functions with continuations are guaranteed never to exit directly, but instead to
        follow at least one of the continuations.  Currently there are no multi-threaded
        exits, so each library function will follow exactly one continuation.  This may
        change in the future.  A continued function typically will not have only one
        continuation, as that would be identical to calling the base function and the
        continuation function in succession.

      <p>
        For convenience we provide some general purpose continuation functions.  One of
        these is the function #'be, which returns a function that returns a given
        value. Hence,

      <pre>
        <code>
          (s tm (be t) (be â))
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        will return true should the step succeed, and return â should it not.  However
        note, that when used in this manner, step will almost surely be followed by a test
        of the return value, and this test will almost surely be doing the same work
        that was done inside the function in order to to detect the end condition.  So one
        of the things we hope to accomplish with this library, is to eliminate this sort
        of redundant testing.

      <p>
        Tape machines can also be implemented over functions rather than containers.  So
        for example, we could have a tape machine that represents the natural numbers.
        Each time it is stepped it just goes to the next integer.  In which case there
        would be no rightmost cell, so we might write:

      <pre>
        <code>
          (s natural-number-generator 
            #'do-nothing
            (Î»()(error 'this-cant-happen))
          )
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        Here #'do-nothing is a void function.  Though the continuation does nothing, the
        step function has done something, because it stepped
        the <i>natural-number-generator</i>. As for the rightmost continuation, if we ever
        hit a bound, then there is a bug in the <i>natural-number-generator</i>, so we
        signal an error.  Note that continuations are functions, and this continuation
        takes no arguments, so the error call must be wrapped in a lambda.  (It is a
        common mistake for beginning users of the library to put as a continuation
        argument a function that is evaluated to a value due to being an argument, rather
        than providing an argument that evaluates to a function.)

      <p>
        Tape machine library functions make all end cases explicit, typically with a
        continuation argument.  We suspect this will simplify analysis tools and make life
        easier for programmers.  It is one of our objectives that code written using tape
        machines will be more amenable to formal analysis.  We discuss this further in
        another chapter.  We believe we have achieved this quality without sacrificing
        performance.


      <p>
        Like #'s above, many of the tape machine functions are single letters.  This
        facilitates stringing them together to create compound access functions, in
        analogy to lisp's car and cdr access language (cadr, caddr, etc.).  See my paper
        "Towards a Better Understanding of CAR, CDR, CADR and the Others".  The access
        language is then extended into a general out of band signaling pattern matching
        language that works on arbitrarily long data types. See the chapter on that
        subject [better to look at the source code, the doc is still being ginned up].

      <p>
        In 2003 I designed a configurable high performance processor for Quickturn
        Technologies (which was only one of the multiple processor designs being done by
        the company).  The processor had a unique two dimensional microcode.  Instead of
        having a fixed pipeline that ran instructions, the first dimension of the
        microcode configured the available ALUs into a pipe appropriate for the given
        task, be it a correlation filter, matrix processing, etc.  The second dimension of
        the microcode implemented the instruction set over the configured ALUs.

      <p>
        I wrote an assembler for the processor, but what was missing was a high level
        programming paradigm.  The Tape machine combined with a special kind of function
        called a <i>worker</i> provides this paradigm in this library.  A worker function
        is defined to accept one or more tape machines, and to produce values for one or
        more tape machines.  Then each call of the worker takes few or no arguments,
        rather it pulls data as needed from the configured source tape machine(s). Per
        call it does one unit of work. It then writes the result(s) to the destination
        tape machine(s). In the absence of dedicated hardware, a worker appears much like
        a function that was derived by currying away its constant tape machine arguments.
        See the chapter on workers for more information.

        <h1> Unicode Usage</h1>

        <p>
          For your convenience there is a file "emacs-keys" in the docs directory of the
          distribution which sets the C-x g <i>name</i> SPC to enter the characters used
          in the library.  Here 'name' is a nickname. I would have preferred being able to
          define my own nicknames and to modify the existing C-x 8 so that such a nickname
          followed by a space would enter a character, but when delving into the emacs
          library I found it to be rather 'Unicode technical'.

        <p>
          So to type the character capital delta when emacs-keys is loaded, type C-x
          g D SPC. Actually Î occurs twice in Unicode, once as capital delta, and once as
          a symbol for 'increment' in mathematics.  We consider the increment version
          to only be there for typography purposes.  We only use capital delta, even
          when it is for an increment variable.

        <p>
          I've limited the use of Unicode to things that 'probably would have been this
          way had Unicode been around before', are conventional notation, and to a couple
          of symbol extensions that were needed to facilitate the access language.

        <p> In the file src-1/fundamental.lisp find synonym bindings for the usual
          operators and common symbols such as â§, â¨, â¥, â¤, Î», â, etc.  

        <p>
          There are three characters used in the library for which there are currently no
          synonyms.  We use the character 'â§' as shorthand for 'leftmost'.  This is
          because it looks like a little tape with the inked over cell being the leftmost
          cell. In the same manner the character 'â¨' is shorthand for rightmost. 

        <p>
          These symbols are used on the single name access language functions as
          modifiers meaning to operate on rightmost or leftmost rather than the cell
          the head is on, or, to specify contracts with the programmer of the sort: "this
          function is only called when the cell is on rightmost."  (Note, operators
          on cells are such things as allocation and deallocation, and these are distinct
          from operators on objects, such as addition and subtraction.)

        <p>
          As we had symbols for leftmost and rightmost I also started using them generally
          to mean leftmost or rightmost wherever that was convenient.  For example,
          to shorten up the names of continuations so that argument lists would fit
          on a line.

        <p>
          As a third symbol I introduced, â³ for 'do'.  Initially this was because all of
          the loop words were already used, but it turns out to work nicely because the
          first argument is often a function that steps, so it looks like a modifier
          meaning repeat stepping, and in fact that is what it is.

      <h1>Nomenclature and Conventions</h1>

        <p>
          A myriad of terms now exist in computer science for talking about memory and end
          cases, but still some things have no conventional terms.  Hence, I feel it is
          important to provide a consistent nomenclature for use when talking about the
          tape machine library.

        <p>
          A tape machine has a <i>tape</i>, an <i>indicator head</i> (or
          just <i>head</i>), and a <i>function interface</i>.  

        <p>
          The tape consists of an array of one or more <i>cell</i>(s). Each cell contains
          exactly one <i>object</i>. An object is either a) a <i>subspace</i> or b) a data
          blob that one hopes has some meaning for the tape machine user. Spaces are
          discussed in the chapter "Spaces".
     
        <p>
          Typically when a tape machine tape has two or more cells, all cells, potentially
          except for two, have two neighbors.  A <i>left neighbor</i> and a <i>right
          neighbor</i>.  The two potentially special cells are called
          <i>leftmost</i>, which has only a right neighbor, and <i>rightmost</i>, which
          has only a left neighbor. However there are other possible topologies.  For
          example the tape may be an abstraction that is maintained through function
          calls, in which case the tape might not have a leftmost or rightmost.  A tape
          may be circular, or even have with loops. We consider a variation with a park
          cell in the chapter on "Dataflow".

        <p>
          The <i>leftmost object</i> is the object in the leftmost cell, etc.

        <p>
          The terminology of <i>left</i> and <i>right</i> stem from the convention in
          mathematics for number lines.  Here the cell addresses fall on a number line.
          Going right on the number line leads to higher addresses, and going left to
          lower addresses.

        <p>
          A one cell machine represents a singularity in our system, as the one cell
          might be defined to be any combination of being its own left neighbor, being its
          own right neighbor, being leftmost and/or being rightmost. We provide
          two such examples in the library, <i>tm-singular-affine</i>, where a one cell
          machine tape has no leftmost or rightmost, and the one cell is both its own left
          neighbor and right neighbor,  and <i>tm-singular-projective</i> where the
          one cell is both rightmost and leftmost.

        <p>
          At any given time the indicator head is either <i>parked</i> or it is <i>on</i>
          exactly one cell.  We say <i>indicator</i> head, rather than the more
          conventional <i>read-write</i> head, because reading and writing are part of the
          function interface.  The purpose of the indicator head is to locate a cell.  The
          object in the indicated cell is called the <i>indicated object</i>, or
          the <i>object indicated by the head</i>. 

        <p>
          Putting the head on a specific cell is to <i>cue</i> the head.  Four cue
          functions are defined in the library: <i>park</i>, <i>cue-leftmost</i>,
          <i>cue-to</i>, and <i>cue-rightmost</i>.  <i>Cue-to</i> cues the head to the
          same tape and location as for another tape machine.  A related
          function <i>dup</i> both makes a new tape machine and cues it to another
          machine.  Yet another function <i>mount</i> can be used to mount a sequence or a
          the tape from anther tape machine. With these functions it is possible to put
          more than one head on the same tape.  Having multiple heads on one tape leads to
          potential hazards when combined with structural operations.  This is discussed
          in the chapter, "Issues".

        <p>
          Heads are either <i>stepped</i>, <i>cued</i>, or <i>parked</i>. We do not apply
          other motion verbs to heads.  In contrast, objects are said to be <i>moved</i>.
          A head is not a tape machine, but it is unambiguous to say "step a tape
          machine". This actually means to step the tape machine's head. However, if one
          says that "a tape machine <i>moved</i>", that means that said tape machine was
          an object, initially it was in one cell, but then it was moved to another
          cell. This distinction between the connotations of stepping and moving becomes
          particularly important after the introduction of "spaces".

        <p>
          The function interface consists of <i>primitive</i> and <i>derived</i>
          functions.  Primitive functions are those with no generic implementation.  A new
          tape machine may be defined by providing an implementation for the primitive
          functions, and that would be sufficient as the derived functions have generic
          implementations in terms of the primitive functions. There are many derived
          functions including those for handling subspaces, for quantification and
          repetition, and for compound operations.

        <p>
          In this implementation, tape-machine is a class with two slots.  One slot is
          called, <i>HA</i> which stands for head address, and the other slot is
          called <i>tape</i>.  Should the tape machine be mounted on a sequence, the tape
          slot is set to the sequence, and HA holds the location in the sequence.  For an
          array HA will be the index for the current cell.  For a list HA will be the
          current cons cell. Derived classes make do with just these two slots, which
          assures that we can consistently <i>cue-to</i> back and forth between
          tape-machine types.

        <p>
          We have two functions for making tape machines, one is <i>tm-mk</i> and the
          other is <i>mount</i>. The function <i>mount</i> takes a sequence and then tries
          to match that up with the best tape machine implementation for the type of
          sequence. Where as <i>tm-mk</i> accepts a tape machine class and an
          initialization value, and then tries to produce an initialized tape machine of
          the specified class type.  The function <i>unmount</i> accepts a tape machine
          and returns the mounted tape. (Note that mount can also be passed another tape
          machine, in which case it returns a new machine that is mounted on the same
          tape.)

        <p>
          Modifications to head location or to the tape contents are said to
          be <i>stateful</i>.  Modifications that add or remove cells from the tape are
          said to be <i>structural</i>.  (Adding cells to the tape is
          called <i>allocation</i>.  Removing cells from the tape is
          called <i>deallocation</i>.)  We know from experience that programs that only
          modify state tend to be simpler than those that modify structure. Yet there
          always seem to be cases, such as gathering results, where structural changes
          are the most convenient type.  Even Scheme allows one to use a cons cell
          to lengthen a list, albeit only from one end.

        <p>
          We use inclusive bounds so we don't need to represent addresses that are outside
          of our address space. 

          <p>
          The typical coding form is to do some work, and then to step. If
          the machine head is on rightmost, then we do something appropriate.

        <h1> List Making Functions</h1>

        <p>
          Because of our method of continuations, and our adoption of workers, we have
          ended up with some extended argument lists. Also because of our allocate and
          deallocate options on the tape machine, we end up with some clean, but
          destructive operations.  In order to reduce these burdens to some extent,
          in the TM library we provide two macros to make list creation a little bit
          easier.  We call them 'q' or [...], and 'L' or {...}.

          <h2>q or [...]</h2>

        <p>
          In Lisp a quoted list is taken as being literal.  However the result of
          modifying a literal is undefined, and often leads to bad results.  Hence we
          provide the macro <i>q</i> which returns a quoted list which is not a literal.

          <pre><sample>
              * (q a b c)
              (A B C)
          </sample></pre>

        <p>
          To make non-literal quoting easier to use we have defined a reader macro over brackets.

          <pre><sample>
              * [a b c]
              (A B C)
          </sample></pre>
            

        <h2>L or {...}</h2>

        <p>
        When a form enclosed in parentheses, ( ... ), is evaluated the head is taken as the
        name of a function, looked up and called.  The list members are also evaluated,
        and then passed as operands to said function.  If we don't want the head treated
        specially, but rather just want to define a list, we can trick the evaluator into
        giving us a list by padding the list with a front item of #'list, which is the
        function to create a list.

        <pre><sample>
            * (list 1 2 (+ 1 2))
            (1 2 3)
        </sample></pre>

        <p>
        We have defined a macro called <i>L</i> that like list, creates a list, but which
        also has some extra functionality.

        <pre><sample>
           * (L 1 2 (+ 1 2))
           (1 2 3)
        </sample></pre>

        <p>
        We also provide a reader macro over braces.

        <pre><sample>
            * { 1 2 (+ 1 2)}
            (1 2 3)
        </sample></pre>

        <p>
        If the apparent function open, #'o, appears inside of a call to L, then the
        arguments of the #'o function are included directly in the resulting list:

        <pre><sample>
            * (defvar a {1 2 3})
            A

            * (defvar b {4 5 6})
            B

            * {a (o b)}
            ((1 2 3) 4 5 6)
        </sample></pre>
        
        <p>
        Quoted non-literals can also occur within such an <i>L</i> list:

        <pre><sample>
            * {a (o b) [a b]}
            ((1 2 3) 4 5 6 (A B))

            * {a (o b) (o [a b])}
            ((1 2 3) 4 5 6 A B)
        </sample></pre>

        <p>
        <i>L</i> is a little bit like quasiquote turned inside out.  Where
        as the default in quasiquote is to quote items, and a comma operator
        turns that off,  the default in <i>L</i> is to evaluate items, and
        a <i>q</i> operator turns that off.   Quasiquote has an @ marker
        to open up lists, while <i>L</i> has an <i>o</i> operator to open
        up lists.

        <p>
        Note however, inside of a quasiquote we could get in trouble if
        the name of a variable starts with an @ character.  If such a variable
        appears after a comma, quasi quote will consider the variable name
        without the @ sign is to be opened and included.  This is an example
        of where 'in-band signaling' causes us to have to make rules to leave
        values out of our data set (or in this case a character out of variable
        names).

        <p>
        There is no analogous problem with <i>o</i> operator because it appears
        within the function channel.

        <h1> Stepping </h1>

        <p>
          Here is a simple program that makes use of a tape machine.

          <pre><code>
              (let(
                    (a-tape-machine (mount {1 2 3}))
                    )
                (print (r a-tape-machine))
                (s a-tape-machine)
                (print (r a-tape-machine))
                (s a-tape-machine)
                (print (r a-tape-machine))
                (s a-tape-machine)
                )
          </code></pre>

        <p>
          When run it produces:

          <pre><sample>
              1 
              2 
              3 
              NIL
          </sample></pre>

        <p>
          #'mount accepts a sequence and returns a tape machine.  Different sequences
          will result in different types of tape machines, but that is typically of
          little importance, as all tape machine share the same function interface.
          After a sequence is mounted, the tape machine head will be on leftmost.

        <p>
          #'r is a function that accepts a tape machine and returns the indicated object.
          #'w does the inverse operation.  It accepts a tape machine and an object, and
          then writes the object into the indicated cell.  Hence, the first <code>(print
          (r a-tape-machine))</code> will print the number 1.

        <p>
          #'s moves the tape head to the right neighbor cell, so the second <code>(print
            (r a-tape-machine))</code> will print the number 2. Etc.  Note we do not
            provide any continuation function arguments to #'s.  They are optional, and
            the defaults are <code>(be t)</code> and <code>(be â)</code>.  That is why at
            the final step, when stepping fails, the program returns NIL.  (The printer is
            not aware of our alias â, so it prints NIL.)

        <p>
          Now it would be more convenient to use a loop to implement this logic.

          <pre><code>
              (let(
                    (a-tape-machine (mount {1 2 3}))
                    )
                (â³ (Î»(cont-loop cont-return)
                      (print (r a-tape-machine))
                      (s a-tape-machine cont-loop cont-return)
                      )))
          </code></pre>

        <p>
          And this time the output is:

          <pre><sample>
              1 
              2 
              3 
              T
          </sample></pre>

        <p>
          In this case the return value comes from loop, and the loop returns T.  In fact
          the default function for the cont-rightmost parameter never runs, instead the
          provided function for <i>cont-return</i> runs.

        <p>
          In general we follow this paradigm, first doing some work, then stepping.  In
          the loop these two operations are performed repeatedly until stepping fails.  Be
          careful when writing TM programs to not be anxious to apply loop operators.
          Instead, prefer to implement functions that do one unit of work, and move the
          looping to a higher level. If you are concerned about the function call overhead
          then declare it as an inline function. 

        <p>
          Notice that unlike the standard loops in Lisp where the location information
          used in iteration is gone after we exit from the loop, we still have the tape
          machine after the loop exits.  We could, for example, cue-leftmost, and process
          the same data again.  When multiple tape machines are involved in a loop, we
          will know where each left off when the loop terminates.  We have a special form
          for looping multiple machines in a transactional manner (i.e they all step or
          none do), it is called <i>â³-together</i>.

        <p>
          Another kind of loop is the quantifier.  All the looping forms are
          defined in the file src-1/tm-quantifiers.  We provide the two main
          quantifiers, #'â  and #'â, and the complement variations of them.

        <p>
          The existence quantifier, #'â accepts a tape machine and a predicate.  It
          starts at leftmost, then steps right cell by cell until the predicate
          is true.  Should the end of the tape be reached, then the quantification
          is false.  Because some work can be done inside the predicate function,
          this is the same thing as loop until.  
         
        <p>
          The universal quantifier, #'â also accepts a tape machine and a predicate.  It
          starts at leftmost, and steps right for as long as the predicate remains true.
          This is the same thing as a while loop.  This quantifier returns false should an
          exception be found, or returns true should the end of the tape be reached.

        <p>
          When called this function will return true:

<pre><code>
  (defun test-â-0 ()
    (let*(
           (y {1 2 {3 4} 5})
           (ytm (mount y))
           )
      (â ytm (Î»(tm)(and (typep (r tm) 'cons) (eql 3 (car (r tm))))))
      (equal (r ytm) '(3 4))
      ))

          accepts a sequence, and returns the most appropriate type of tape machine,
          #'tm-mk requires the user to specify the tape machine type.  It also accepts an
          optional list of initialization parameters.  The initialization parameters can
          be of any type that is supported by the #'tm-mk methods.  If no initialization
          parameter is supplied, as is the case here, a tape machine is created with an
          empty tape and a parked head.

        <p>
          The function #'a allocates a new cell just to the right of the head, and
          it initializes that cell with the object specified in the call. In this
          example this is the square of the number specified on the source.  #'as
          is a compound command.  The compound contains allocate and step.  So in
          our example here, after the call to #'as the head will be on the newly
          allocated cell. We can repeat the call to #'as and grow the length of the
          tape. The nice part about this approach, as unlike using the conventional
          cons cell at the front, the element order in the destination list will be
          the same as the element order in the source list.
          
        <p>
          #'unmount is the inverse of #'mount.  It returns the tape, and as it is the last
          statement in our code, it provides the return value.  Should this output then be
          evaluated, we will have a list.  Alternatively we could have returned <code>(cdr
          (unmount destination))</code> and the head of the returned list would be the
          number 1.

        <p>
          A <i>worker</i> is a program type.  Any program that accepts input from a source
          tape machine, and then produces output on a destination tape machine, and does
          so one step at a time, is a <i>worker</i>.  The worker in this example is
          <i>(as destination (expt (r source) 2))</i>.  The amount of work done upon each
          call to the worker is <i>one unit of work</i>.

        <p>
          Notice, that each time we call a worker its source and destination machine
          arguments are the same.  These can be curried away.  Or put another way, we
          might think of a worker as being connected into the program rather than as
          accepting arguments that evaluate to values upon each call.  We provide a macro
          for creating a worker connection function.  This macro does the currying, or the
          connecting, whichever way you want to think about it.

<pre><code>
(defmacro def-worker (name src dst state conts &body body) ...)

src := tape-machine-name | (tape-machine-name ..) | ()
dst := tape-machine-name | (tape-machine-name ..) | ()
state := symbol | (symbol ..) | ()
conts := contination-name | (continuation-name ..) | ()

tape-machine-name := symbol (evaluates to a tape machine)
contination-name := symbol  (evaluates to a continuation function)

</code></pre>

          <p>
          <i>name</i> is a symbol, and is the name of the resulting connection
          function.  The connection function will be used to get a worker
          function, and that worker function will takes no arguments.

          <p>
          <i>src</i> is either a symbol that will evaluate to a
          source tape machine, a list of such symbols, or an empty set of
          parentheses, ie. an empty list.  When <i>src</i> is a symbol, the connection
          function will accept a single tape machine as a first argument.  When
          <i>src</i> is specified as a list, then the connector expects a list of tape
          machines as a first argument.  The list will be deconstructed, so the programmer
          may use &optional, &rest, and other such parameter keywords when specifying the
          list of symbols.  When <i>src</i> is an empty set of parentheses, the connection
          function does not have a src parameter, it is skipped.  The other parameters are
          handled in an analogous way.  See src-2/worker.lisp for the macro definition.

          <p>
          Here is a simple example of defining a worker.

          <pre><code>
            (def-worker counter tm-src () boxed-counter ()
              (s tm-src
                (Î»()(incf (unbox boxed-counter)) t)
                (be â)
                ))
          </pre></code>

        <p>
          Here the connection function is called <i>counter</i>.  The connection
          function will take a single source tape machine, it does not accept
          any destination tape machines.  It accepts a single state variable.  As
          this function does not write to a destination machine, its purpose is
          solely to evolve the state.

        <p>
          Each unit of work here evolves the state by incrementing the counter.  We
          require that all variables be passed by reference, which is the default in Lisp
          for complex objects, but alas, not for integers.  Hence we pass the counter "in
          a box".  Box is defined in src-0/functions.lisp.

        <p>
          This function returns true when called:

          <pre><code>
            (defun test-worker-1 ()
              (let*(
                    (tm (mount {0 1 2 3}))
                    (cnt 0)
                    (worker (counter tm (box cnt)))
                    )
                  (â§
                    (= cnt 0)
                    (funcall worker)
                    (= cnt 1)
                    (funcall worker)
                    (= cnt 2)
                    (funcall worker)
                    (= cnt 3)
                    (Â¬ (funcall worker))
                    )
                  ))
          </pre></code>

        <p>
          We call #'counter to connect the worker.  After this each call to the
          worker does one unit of work.  In the last term of the conjunction
          the worker refuses to do anymore work, and returns false.  We use
          not, Â¬, to cause the term to be true.

        <p>
          The worker in this example does not conform to our convention of
          continuing end cases. Also it would be better to produce a result
          so as to simplify the test.  Here is a conforming implementation:

<pre><code>
(def-worker counter-2 tm-src tm-dst boxed-counter (cont-ok cont-â¨)
  (as tm-dst (unbox boxed-counter))
  (s tm-src 
    (Î»()
      (incf (unbox boxed-counter)) 
      (funcall cont-ok)
      )
    cont-â¨
    ))
 </pre></code>

        <p>
          Here we have used our abbreviations of â¨ to stands for 'rightmost', so cont-â¨ is
          read as "continue rightmost".  Each time the worker is called there is
          a new unprocessed value on the source tape machine waiting.  In this case
          we just push it to the destination machine.  Then we step, if we find that
          stepping is not possible, then we call cont-â¨. Once the worker has called
          cont-â¨ either it will not be called again, because the work is done, or
          new data will be placed on the tape machine.  

        <p>
          Note that we applied the #'incf inside the ok continuation of the step.  This is
          a demonstration of our convention of using inclusive bounds.  In this manner no
          false step is taken at the end, so the counter will never exceed in size the
          maximum index that would be needed to index the input tape. However,
          if it were the case that the tape was to be loaded with more data and the
          operation continued, we would need to adjust the count to keep it in
          synch, before continuing our operation.

        <p>
          The following function returns true:
          
<pre><code>
  (defun test-worker-2 ()
    (let*(
          (tm-src (mount {0 1 2 3}))
          (tm-dst (tm-mk 'tm-list))
          (cnt 0)
          (worker (counter-2 tm-src tm-dst (box cnt)))
          )
       (â³ (Î»(cont-loop cont-return)
            (funcall worker cont-loop cont-return)
            ))
        (â§
          (= cnt 3)
          (equal
             (unmount tm-src)
             (unmount tm-dst)
             ))))
</pre></code>

        <h1> Spaces </h1>

        <p>
        A space is a place to put one or more objects.  It has two components, cells to
        hold object(s), and an addressing mechanism.  The addressing mechanism allows us
        to associate a symbol with a cell in the space. If the set of addressing symbols
        have topological properties, then those properties then apply to the space.  For
        example, if we use natural numbers as the symbols associated to cells as a
        definition for addressing, then because natural numbers have an order
        relationship, the cells have neighbors.  It follows that each tape machine defines
        a space, and each tape machine type defines a type of space.

        <h2> Void </h2> 

        <p>
        Void space is something that shares some of the properties of other spaces, but
        lacks the property being able to recall that which has been written.  We have two
        interpretations of void.  One is based on a infinite dilution, and the other that
        a void space having no volume, and thus can not not be written in the first place.
        We call the infinite dilution model <i>affine</i>, and the can't hold
        anything <i>projective</i>. (These terms are derived from the limiting case of the
        interpretation of infinity on a number line, as that number line holds address
        the number line has fewer and fewer, and eventually no addresses.)

        <p>
        In the colloquial void affine is the <i>bit bucket</i>.  One can step a
        tm-void-affine machine, write to it, and do anything defined on the machine
        interface, but reading always returns â.

        <p>
        The void-projective machine is a kind of â machine. Any attempt to read it or
        write it will result in an error.  All operations are boundary operations, for
        example stepping will result in rightmost continuation.


        <h2> Singular Projective </h2>

        <p>
        The projective singular space, <i>tm-singular-projective</i>, has only one cell on
        its tape. It shares the property of other spaces in being finite and having
        boundaries, but it lacks expansiveness.  The one cell is both the leftmost and
        rightmost cell, so any attempt to step from it results in a continuation call. Any
        attempts to expand the space using an allocation operation, results in
        a <i>cont-no-alloc</i> call.  In fact it behaves just like a tape machine mounted
        on a one element fixed array.

        <p>
        Using a singular projective space is a good way to assert that a tape has
        exactly one value.

        <h2> Singular Affine </h2>

        <p>
        The affine singular space, <i>tm-singular-affine</i> has one cell, and the right
        neighbor of that cell is the cell itself.  The left neighbor of this one cell, is
        also the cell itself.  This is the same as saying the tape is unbounded in both
        directions, and that all cells are simply a window into a single value, or that
        all cells hold a reference to the same value.  Stepping, allocating, and
        deallocating from singular affine will always be <i>cont-ok</i>.

        <p>
          The singular affine space collapses the tape machine type into a regular
          variable.

        <h2>Region </h2>

        <p>
        <i>tm-region</i> is a tape machine with a finite tape, i.e. one that has a
        defined leftmost and rightmost cell, and this finite tape is a portion of another
        machine's tape.  <i>tm-region</i> is initialized from two other tape machines.
        One with its head on the region leftmost, and one with its head on the region
        rightmost.

        <p>
        The following function returns true:

        <pre><code>
          (defun test-tm-region-0 ()
            (let*(
                  (base-tm (mount [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7]))
                  (left-machine (dup base-tm))
                  (right-machine (dup base-tm))
                  )
              (sn left-machine 3)
              (sn right-machine 5)
              (let*(
                     (an-region 
                       (make-region 
                         :leftmost left-machine 
                         :rightmost right-machine
                         ))
                     (tm-region (tm-mk 'tm-region an-region))
                     )
                (â§
                  (on-leftmost tm-region)
                  (= (r tm-region) 3)
                  (s tm-region)
                  (= (r tm-region) 4)
                  (s tm-region)
                  (= (r tm-region) 5)
                  (on-rightmost tm-region)
                  (Â¬ (s tm-region))
                  )
                  )))
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          The function <i>dup</i> accepts a tape machine and returns another tape machine
          that shares the same tape and has a head on the same cell.  It is useful for
          setting check points to come back to.  In this context it is used to create
          markers for the leftmost and rightmost of the region. The function #'sn
          steps <i>n</i> times.  The region tape machine is initialized from a structure
          that has two fields (two slots in Lisp argot) one for each inclusive bound of the
          region space.
          
        <p>
          The function #'a allocates a new cell to the right of the cell that the head is
          on.  When the head is on the rightmost of the region, the allocated cell
          remains in the region. A region is a self contained space, and given an
          region machine there is no way to detect that the region is part of a larger
          space. If that information is needed it should be saved when the region is
          created, or derived from the space that contains the region.

        <h2>Subspace </h2>

        <p>
          A subspace is a tape machine created from an object that is found in the cell of
          another space. We provide a number of functions in the library for making use of
          subspaces.  The base function is "step into", #'si.  #'si takes as an argument a
          tape machine and it has two continuations,
          <i>cont-ok</i> and <i>cont-mount-failed</i>.  #'si will continue with
          <i>cont-ok</i> if the object in the cell that the tape is on, i.e. the indicated
          object, can be mounted.  #'mount is a generic interface, and so this is the same
          to say that #'si will succeed if an corresponding method for the object type has
          been defined for #'mount.

        <p>
          This function returns true:

          <pre><code>
           (defun test-si-0 ()
             (let*(
                    (y '(1 2 (3 4) 5))
                    (ytm (tm-mk 'tm-list y))
                    )
               (s ytm)
               (s ytm)
               (si ytm)
               (eql (r ytm) 3)
               ))
          </code></pre>

        <p>
          Once in a subspace, the leftmost cell is the leftmost of the subspace, the
          rightmost the rightmost of the subspace, etc.  As for region spaces there is
          no way from within the subspace to detect the existence of the superspace. Hence
          in order to step back out of the subspace one first uses #'dup to get a copy of
          the tape machine before stepping in, and then steps in while using either copy,
          and resumes later in the superspace with the other copy.  See src-1/tm-depth and
          src-1/tm-breadth, the tree traversal transforms, for examples.

        <h1> Initializing Tape Machines </h1>

        <h2> Empty = â -- Was Impractical for General Use</h2>

        <p>
          One of the approaches we have tried for handling initialization was to use â to
          represent a tape machine until the first allocation call provided an object to
          initialize the machine against.  This had the nice attribute that all tape
          machines had valid data that could be read, so the read function required
          neither continuation function arguments, nor code to throw an error.

        <p>
          However, we ran into a problem.  While tape machines are passed by reference, â
          is passed by value.  Hence a function that might provide the first data value
          could not actually initialize the machine, except local to the function.  We
          considered splitting tape machine user functions into <i>first call</i> version
          and <i>next call</i> versions, but sometimes it is unclear who produces the
          first value or when it is produced.  Furthermore some functions take multiple
          tape machine inputs. So the approach was deemed impractical for general use.

        <h2> Empty Machines Have a Padding Cell -- Caused Complications</h2>

        <p>
          Another approach we tried out was to give an empty machine a padding cell.
          We even put a value in the padding cell to mark the tape type.  This approach
          had some drawbacks. 

        <p>
          Firstly, it was not possible to distinguish a machine with a padding cell from a
          machine with one real cell, so we had to rely on the programmer to correctly
          account for such machines, and to carry an awareness of that accounting into
          the debug phase.

          Secondly, the choice of padding cell became more complicated when we moved
          beyond the basic machines.  Say for example, what if the tape type meant that
          cells hold tape machines.  Then the padding cell needs to hold a tape machine,
          but that machine needs to be initialized.  As another example, suppose the tape
          cells had to hold large objects, are we to set aside memory just so we can
          represent an empty machine?  That seems counter intuitive.

          Thirdly, the padding cells had to be removed before an unmounted tape could be
          used, as often the rest of the Lisp world did not need the object in the padding
          cell.  Again this place a burden on the programmer to properly account for this.


        <h2> Void with Tape Subspace -- Our Current Model </h2>

        <p>
          Our current model is that all tape machines have two connected internal spaces.
          One space is void projective, and the other space is defined by the tape.
          Should the tape be â, then that second space is not present. One might say
          that the void projective space is a place to <i>park</i> the tape head.

        <p>
          Because void projective spaces do not require initialization we can
          create such a tape machine before initialization data is available.
          The tape head for such a machine will be in the void space, and the
          tape space will not be present.

        <p>
          If the head is in the void space when #'a is called, we follow an
          internally defined cont-no-alloc continuation. In this continuation the machine
          allocates and initializes a cell at the leftmost of the tape space. If the tape
          space is empty, it will become singular projective.  If it is not empty, then it
          becomes longer with the addition of a new leftmost cell.

        <p>
          In an analogous manner, if the head is in the void space and it is stepped, that
          step internally invokes the cont-rightmost continuation for the void space, and
          in that continuation, if the tape space exists, we step the head into the tape
          space and put it on leftmost.  If the tape space does not exist, then we invoke
          the cont-rightmost function supplied by the user in the step call.

        <p>
          In this manner we have created a hierarchy of spaces, with the tape space being
          a subspace to the void space.  As for other subspaces, once the head is in the
          subspace, there is no way to detect the presence of the superspace. Stepping
          left from leftmost of the subspace invokes cont-leftmost, and stepping right
          from rightmost invokes cont-rightmost, etc.

        <p>
          If left stepping or allocation is defined for the machine, then we create a dual
          system for stepping or allocating to the left.

        <p>
          Within the tape space, primitive allocation occurs to the right of the cell the
          head is on.  Hence the cell the head is on becomes an attachment cell for new
          cells.  When we gather new outputs from a function, these outputs then appear to
          the right of the attachment cell.  Hence the primary mode of use for gathering
          outputs is that the attachment cell is not read or written, but rather it is
          just attached to.  Take for example our stack implementation when the tape
          machine is mounted on a list. Pushing (enqueue) something on the stack
          allocates a cell to the right of the attachment cell.  Pulling from (dequeue)
          the stack causes the cell to the right of the attachment cell to be deallocated.
          The stack never reads from nor writes to the attachment cell.

        <p>
          These continuation definitions for the void projective space set up a morphism
          between the head being in the void space and the head being placed on an
          attachment cell. In both cases, creating a new allocation will put the cell in a
          place that is reached by taking a step.  In both cases we do not expect the
          attachment point itself to be read or written.  In the case of the void
          projective space, such a read or write will be an error, in the case of an
          attachment point, one would be writing outside of the structure being attached
          (such as in the stack example of the prior paragraph).

        <p>
          Hence, with this approach the user may use an un-initialized machine for capturing
          output, just as he would use an initialized one.  He or she need not predict the
          arrival of a first result, nor have to handle first results in a special manner.
          Unlike in the padding approach, uninitialized machines can be recognized by
          using the <i>parked</i> or <i>empty</i> predicates, and they do not carry unused
          allocations.

        <h1> Generators </h1>

        <p>
          A generator is a tape machine that produces values despite having never been
          written to or initialized with the values.  It may be initialized with some seed
          parameters.  Typically such machines have no rightmost, rather on each step will
          just make yet another cell value available.

        <p>
          Perhaps the simplest generator would be a tm-singular-affine machine initialized
          with a value.  This would be a constant generator.

          <h2> tm-line </h2>

        <p>
          This is soon to be replaced with a more flexible generator.

        <p>
          <i>tm-line</i> is a tape machine that takes as an initialization an initial
          value, an inclusive bounding value - or nil, and an increment.  It then sums the
          increment into the initial value upon each step to the right.  Thus it
          successively produces a sequence of numbers.

        <p>
          The following function returns true:

          <pre><code>
              (defun test-tm-line-0 ()
                (let(
                      (tm-src (tm-mk 'tm-line (make-line :bound 5)))
                      (tm-dst (tm-mk 'tm-list))
                      )
                  (â³ (Î»(cont-loop cont-return)
                       (as tm-dst (r tm-src))
                       (s tm-src cont-loop cont-return)
                       ))
                  (equal
                    (cdr (to-list tm-dst))
                    [0 1 2 3 4 5]
                    )
                  ))

        <h1> Transforms </h1>

        <p>
          Tape machine transforms are tape machines that bind to other tape machines and
          provide the information in the base tape machine though in a different manner.

        <p>
          Currently we provide three tape machine
          transforms.  <i>tm-depth</i>, and <i>tm-breadth</i>.

        <p>
          <i>tm-depth</i> is initialized with another tape machine.  When step, #'s, is
          called, <i>tm-depth</i> follows a depth first traversal of the base machine.
          I.e. whenever it encounters an object that can be mounted, it pushes a duplicate,
          mounts the object, and steps into it.  When it reaches the end of a subspace it
          pops off the prior check point and continues from there.  The user just sees
          the depth first traversal as through it were linear.

        <p>
          <i>tm-breadth</i> is initialized with another tape machine. #'s follows a
          breadth first traversal through the base machine.

        <h1> Issues </h1>

        <p>
          Changes to the head location or the contents of cell on the tape are said to
          be <i>stateful</i> changes.  Changes to the number of cells on the tape are said
          to be <i>structural</i> changes.  The two ways to change structure are through
          allocation and deallocation.  Some tape machines can not go through structural
          changes, for example those that mount fixed arrays.

        <p>
          When there are no structural changes, then, in theory it is not possible to
          break a tape machine.  What we mean by break, is that it is not possible when
          using calls to the interface to make it such that a tape machine does not
          respond in the manner defined by the interface functions. I say in theory,
          because this is the intention of the architectural design.  It is possible that
          this intention has not been translated into a perfect design or perfect
          implementation.

        <p>
          In a second scenario, one with a single head on a tape, i.e. when the function
          #'dup has never been called, in theory it is also not possible to break a tape
          machine - even in the presence of structure changing operations.  Allocate and
          Deallocate have been carefully designed so as to achieve this property.

        <p>
          Even in the presence of multiple heads and structural changes, tape machines still
          can not be broken if those operations are used while checking for and avoiding
          hazards.  One example of this is the implementation of <i>tm-region</i>.  So
          what are the hazards?

        <h2> Deletion of the Cell the Head is on Hazard</h2>                  

        <p>
          So now we have the case where #'dup has been called, and structural changes are
          allowed.  One of the duplicates could be used used to deallocate a cell
          indicated by the head of the other duplicate.  This is very easy to set up.
          Just dup a tape machine, step one of the duplicates, and call deallocate on the
          other.  The behavior of a tape machine with an indicated cell that has been
          deallocated is undefined, for good reason, as we are not sure what will happen,
          but are fairly sure it will often be bad.

        <p>
          We rely on the programmer to maintain a contract with us that he will never
          write code that leaves a tape machine head dangling in such a manner.  We did
          consider a programmed solution, but it does not seem right for Lisp, it is
          discussed in the next section.

        <h2> Fix for Multiple Heads and Structure Change Hazard <br>
          ... and why it was not implemented
        </h2>


        <p>
          The fix is to add a third slot to the tape machine class. In this third
          slot we have list or references to tape machines that have a head on the
          tape.  Then upon applying a destructive change to the tape, we check the
          head locations for all the listeners, and if there is a conflict we
          take a conflict continuation path.

        <p>
          I did not implement this, at least on this version of the library, because
          of the manner in which memory allocation is done in Lisp.  In Lisp when
          we are done using something, the garbage collector sees that, and the unused
          stuff goes away.  So, if we put a tape machine on a listener list, it
          always looks used, and it never goes away. 
          
        <p>
          We can introduce a destructor that must be called to explicitly release a tape
          machine, but that would go against conventional programming practices in Lisp.

        <p>
          There appears to be some tricky ways around all this, but those are too involved
          to implement at the current level of developer engagement ;-) .. i.e. it looks
          like too much work for me at this time.

      <h2> Allocation on Arrays </h2>

        <p>
          In Lisp we have two types of arrays to think about, the extendable array
          and the fixed array. 

        <p>
          Allocation requires creating a new cell to the right of the current
          cell. If we are at the rightmost cell, then we can move the fill pointer
          of the extendable array, and we have an allocation.  Conversely, if
          we are one away from rightmost, we can deallocate by moving the fill
          pointer back. 
          
        <p>
          For a fixed array, we do not have a fill pointer, so we will instantly just
          take <i>cont-no-alloc</i>.

        <p>
          When the head is in the middle of the array, allocation can be accomplished
          by moving all the objects found to the right of the head to the right,
          and then bumping up the fill pointer.  We refer to this technique as
          <i>emulating allocation</i>.

        <p>
          If there are multiple heads on the tape we run into a problem with
          emulating allocation.  When we move the objects right as part of an
          operation on one tape machine, the object in the cell the head is
          on changes for all other tape machines with heads further to the right.

        <p>
          The problem with emulating allocation on arrays when there are multiple
          tape heads can also be fixed with a listener list, as discussed above.

        <p> But why perform emulated allocation when there is a move function, #'m that is
          more suited for manipulating data in arrays?  By definition when objects are
          moved right with the move function, the object in a particular cell to the right
          will change.  Also by definition, objects that fall off the end are just thrown
          away, so #'m even works on fixed length arrays. (If the programmer wants to keep
          objects that would fall of the end, he or she can copy them first.  We do not
          need an explicit copy function, as write, #'w, already accepts an initialization
          object, and #'w* accepts an initialization machine, and thus is a copy
          function.)

      <h2> Data Movement Over Lists </h2>

        <p>
          When only one tape head is involved, data movement can be efficiently
          emulated over a list by allocating a new cell to the right, and deallocating
          rightmost.  However, when there are multiple heads involved, we run
          into the problem that the objects in the cells under those heads does
          not change, which is an specified behavior for #'m.

        <p>
          When the mounted list is singly linked, employing a listener list will not help
          with the problem of multiple heads, because to make it look like data moved
          right, the other machine heads would have to step left, which is not implemented.

      <h2> Design Decision about the Listener List </h2>

        <p>
          Due to the considerations explained above, for this version of the tape machine
          library it seems to make most sense to use tape machine type specific functions
          for making cells available for use, and analogous operations, with the exception
          of allowing rightmost allocation on extendable arrays.  The type of the tape can
          be checked by unmounting and then using typeof or typep.

        <p>
          In the presence of multiple tape heads and destructive operations, we suggest
          that the programmer provide at least a sketch of a proof as to why hazards will
          not occur, or that that a tool is used to attempt to check this automatically
          (it may not be possible in general).  Also note, the tape machine library did
          not create container use hazards, rather it is only formalizing their
          description.

      <h2> Multithreaded, Multiple Heads, and Structural Changes </h2>

        <p>
          The above remarks apply.  In addition structural changes typically will have
          to be thread mutually exclusive.

        <h1> Error Sources and Handling </h1>

        <h2> Error Sources </h2>

        <p>
          Computing consists of operation and decision making.  A function is stateless
          message acceptor that performs operations and makes decisions. It may also
          generate new messages.  Because a function is stateless, each symbol it receives
          on its input is handled independently from all the symbols that came before it
          in the message stream. Hence, it is more specific to say that a function is a
          symbol manipulator.

        <p>
          When most of the symbols presented to a function cause the internal decision
          gates to be set one way, while one or a few cause them to be set another way, we
          say that those few symbols represent <i>end cases</i>.  End cases annoy
          programmers because they defy a programmer's sense of efficiency.  Why do as
          much programming work for a few symbols, as for the lion's share of the others?
          Often times we use Shannon factorization to handle end cases, which is to say we
          write code that handles the bulk of the inputs, and then branch elsewhere to
          handle the end cases.  Not properly recognizing and handling end cases is
          a common source of program bugs.

        <p>
          In addition to not handling end cases correctly, programmers might also
          make other mistakes and produce malformed code.  And even well formed code
          might fail to implement the requirements.

        <p>
          Much of programming shadows mathematics or other formalisms. However computation
          has limitations, and it is often not possible, or at least not practical, to
          create computational isomorphisms for these formal systems.  This means that
          programs might have divergent behavior.  When a program diverges beyond what
          is considered to be good approximation, it has failed.  Of course, it is
          good behavior for a program to tell the user when it has diverged.  When a
          program does this we say it is <i>trustworthy</i>.  When a program always
          delivers convergent results, we say it is <i>reliable</i>.

        <p>
          As GÃ¶del pointed out, any formal system of sufficient complexity will either
          have inconsistencies or there will be things that can not be expressed.  For
          example, we know that a Turing Machine can not provide a solution to the halting
          problem.  This means, for example, if we have a compiler component who's job is
          to look at functions in source code and to decide if they will return or not,
          that this component will sometimes fail, even if it was written bug free.  Now
          here is an interesting question, can such a program be trustworthy by telling us
          when it is going to fail?

        <p>
          Even aside from formalism, programs run on real hardware, and sometimes
          the world throws curve balls, such as data not arriving, bits being corrupted, or
          hardware failing. In digital computing we go to great lengths to prevent such
          things from piercing the lower levels of communication protocols, or to be
          detected before a program is run.


        <h2> When to Continue, When to Throw </h2>

        <p>
          With a programming library we can only hope to facilitate programmers in their
          attempt to write trustworthy and reliable code.  This facility comes in the form
          of syntax for control flows.  As one example, by providing direct support for
          Shannon Factorization.

        <p>
          Decisions result in changes in control flow.  This is true whether the decision
          is offsetting end case work, detecting an error, or is just part of processing
          data.  Typically we write functions to solve a focused problem, and then defer
          the end cases.  In TM we provide function continuations to support this
          approach.  In this paradigm we do not throw errors or conditions for such end
          cases, at least not directly.  If the programmer cares to throw an error, he or
          she does that from within the continuation.

        <p>
          We do throw errors for things that should not have happened if our program
          design had been correct as intended.  For example, falling off of the bottom of
          a case form, when we believed all cases had been addressed.

        <p>
          The library author can not know how a library function will be used. It may be
          obvious to the user that certain end cases can not occur.  These continuations
          sometimes default to error messages.  Continuations that would represent a
          failure if taken, but believed to never be taken, should be capped off with a
          function that throws an error.  It is surprising how often 'this-cant-happen gets
          thrown.  Often it is due to small edits where the ramifications were not
          thought through.

        <p>
          We keep a number of contracts with the user of the library.  For example, we
          agree with the user that he or she will only try to #'mount basic sequences that
          are known to the library.  When such contracts are broken, we may throw an
          error.  Often contracts are recursive, i.e. the library user relied upon other
          contracts (including the library authors), so there is a high probability of
          broken contracts.

        <p>
          An example of such a contract with the Common Lisp TM library is that of not
          allocating new cells on fixed array tape machine types.  Though the programmer
          requires that his function never be passed a fixed array tape machine, it still
          might happen.  When it does the allocation routine will take a cont-no-alloc
          continuation, and that will lead to an error being thrown, something like
          'you-promised-not-to-do this.  In contrast, if there was no contract, or the
          contract was not trusted, the cont-no-alloc path would do something to emulate
          the allocation on the array type machine, perhaps by moving objects around.

        <h2> Data Flow Support</h2>

        <p>
          In a dataflow model of computation, in front of each function there is a
          synchronizer that collects tokens and inputs.  When a matched set of tokens is
          found, the input set is then dispatched to the function.  We provide such
          synchronizers to be used as guard checks for inputs and to be used in
          multithreaded environments.

        <p>
          For example, the function #'synch, accepts a number of tape machines, a
          predicate, or a list of predicates.  The single predicate is applied to all input
          tape machines, or the predicates in a list are matched up in order.  If all the
          predicates are true, then the function takes a cont-ready continuation,
          otherwise it takes cont-not-ready.  The cont-not-ready branch may do any number
          of things, including fixing the problem and retrying the #'synch call.  A common
          use of #'synch is to check that none of the input machines are parked.  This
          sets an obvious proof target, as in this case if the condition of a parked input
          tape machine can't happen, the synch call is not needed.
