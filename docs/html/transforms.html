        <h1> Transforms </h1>

        <p>
          Tape machine transforms are tape machines that bind to other tape machines and
          provide the information in the base tape machine though in a different manner.

        <p>
          Currently we provide three tape machine
          transforms.  <i>tm-transform</i>, <i>tm-depth</i>, and <i>tm-breadth</i>.

        <p>
          <i>tm-transform</i> is initialized with two functions and a tape machine.
          The two functions are called the read function, and the write function.
          Each of these functions accepts a value, and returns a value.  When
          the tape is read, the read value for the base tape machine is given to
          the read function, and the result is returned as the tm-transform value.
          The inverse operation is done for writing while using the write function.
          The two functions can be the same.  Strictly speaking, it would be
          possible to provide read and write functions that mask information.

        <p>
          <i>tm-depth</i> is intialized with another tape machine.  When step, #'s, is
          called on <i>tm-depth</i>, follows a depth first traversal of the base machine.
          I.e. whenever it encouters an object that can be mounted, it pushes a duplicate,
          mounts the object, and steps into it.  When it reaches the end of a subspace it
          pops off the prior check point and continues from there.  The user just sees
          the depth first traversal as through it were linear.

        <p>
          <i>tm-breadth</i> is intialized with another tape machine. #'s follows a
          breadth first traversal through the base machine.

        <p>
          In the near future we will combine tm-line's replacement with array
          tape machines to create multidimensional interpretations of a tape, etc.
