      <h1>Nomenclature and Conventions</h1>

        <p>
          A myriad of terms now exist in computer science for talking about memory and end
          cases, but still some things have no conventional terms.  Hence, I feel it is
          important to provide a consistent nomenclature for use when talking about the
          tape machine library.

        <p>
          A tape machine has a <i>tape</i>, an <i>indicator head</i> (or
          just <i>head</i>), and a <i>function interface</i>.  

        <p>
          The tape consists of an array of one or more <i>cell</i>(s). Each cell contains
          exactly one <i>object</i>. An object is either a) a <i>subspace</i> or b) a data
          blob that one hopes has some meaning for the tape machine user. Spaces are
          discussed in the chapter "Spaces".
     
        <p>
          Because cell allocation requires an initialization object, it is not possible to
          have an uninitialized cell. If a machine can not be initialized, or it must
          become empty, the machine in its entirety may be replaced by ∅ (nil). When no
          initialization value is provided for making a tape, we build a one cell machine,
          where the object in that cell is a symbol representing the type of the tape.
          When building macros this is actually what is needed. For other cases there is a
          library function, d◧ (deallocate leftmost), which will drop the first cell from
          a tape.

        <p>
          When a tape machine tape has two or more cells, all cells, potentially except for
          two, have two neighbors.  A <i>left neighbor</i> and a <i>right neighbor</i>.  The
          two potentially special cells are called
          <i>leftmost</i>, which has only a right neighbor, and <i>rightmost</i>, which has
          only a left neighbor. The tape may be an abstraction that is maintained through
          function calls, in which case the tape might not have a leftmost or rightmost.

        <p>
          The <i>leftmost object</i> is the object in the leftmost cell, etc.

        <p>
          A one cell macchine represents a singularity in our system, as the one cell
          might be defined to be any combination of being its own left neighbor, being its
          own right neighbor, being leftmost and/or being rightmost. We provide
          two such examples in the library, <i>tm-singular-affine</i>, where a one cell
          machine tape has no leftmost or rightmost, and the one cell is both its own left
          neighbor and right neighbor,  and <i>tm-singular-projective</i> where the
          one cell is both rightmost and leftmost.

        <p>
          At any given time the indicator head is <i>on</i> exactly one cell.  We say
          <i>indicator</i> head, rather than the more conventional
          <i>read-write</i> head, because reading and writing are part of the function
          interface.  The purpose of the indicator head is to locate a cell.  The object
          in the indicated cell is called the <i>indicated object</i>, or the <i>object
            indicated by the head</i>.  

        <p>
          Putting the head on a specific cell is to <i>cue</i> the head.  Three cue
          functions are defined in the library: <i>cue-leftmost</i>, <i>cue-to</i>, and
          <i>cue-rightmost</i>.  <i>Cue-to</i> cues the head to the same tape and location
          as for another tape machine.  A related function <i>dup</i> both makes a new
          tape machine and cues it to another machine.  With these functions it is
          possible to put more than one head on the same tape.  Having multiple heads on
          one tape leads to potential hazards when combined with structural operations.
          This is discussed in the chapter, "Issues".

        <p>
          Heads are either <i>stepped</i> or <i>cued</i>. We do not apply other motion
          verbs to heads.  In contrast, objects are said to be <i>moved</i>.  A head is
          not a tape machine, but it is unambiguous to say "step a tape machine". This
          actually means to step the tape machine's head. However, if one says that "a
          tape machine <i>moved</i>", that means the tape machine is an object and it was
          moved to another cell. This distinction between the connotations of stepping and
          moving becomes particularly important after the introduction of "spaces".

        <p>
          The function interface consists of <i>primitive</i> and <i>derived</i>
          functions.  Primitive functions are those with no generic implementation.  A new
          tape machine may be defined by providing an implementation for the primitive
          functions, and that would be sufficient as the derived functions have generic
          implementations in terms of the primitive functions. There are many derived
          functions including those for handling subspaces, for quantification and
          repetition, and for compound operations.

        <p>
          In this implementation, tape-machine is a class with two slots.  One slot is
          called, <i>HA</i> which stands for head address, and the other slot is
          called <i>tape</i>.  Should the tape machine be mounted on a sequence, the tape
          slot is set to the sequence, and HA holds the location in the sequence.  For an
          array HA will be the index for the current cell.  For a list HA will be the
          current cons cell. Derived classes make do with just these two slots, which
          assures that we can consistently <i>cue-to</i> back and forth between
          tape-machine types.

        <p>
          We have two functions for making tape machines, one is <i>tm-mk</i> and the
          other is <i>mount</i>. The function <i>mount</i> takes only a sequence and then
          tries to match that up with the best tape machine implementation for the type of
          sequence. Where as <i>tm-mk</i> accepts a tape machine class and an
          initialization value, and then tries to produce an initialized tape machine of
          the specified class type.  The function <i>unmount</i> accepts a tape machine
          and returns the mounted tape.

        <p>
          Modifications to head location or to the tape contents are said to
          be <i>stateful</i>.  Modifications that add or remove cells from the tape are
          said to be <i>structural</i>.  (Adding cells to the tape is
          called <i>allocation</i>.  Removing cells from the tape is
          called <i>deallocation</i>.)  We know from experience that programs that only
          modify state tend to be simpler than those that modify structure. Yet there
          always seem to be cases, such as gathering results, where structural changes
          are the most convenient type.  Even Scheme allows one to use a cons cell
          to lengthen a list, albeit only from one end.

        <p>
          We use inclusive bounds so we don't need to represent addresses that are outside
          of our address space.  The typical mode is to do some work, and then to step. If
          the machine head is on rightmost, then we do something appropriate.
