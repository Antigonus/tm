      <h1>Nomenclature</h1>

        <p>
          A myriad of terms now exist in computer science for talking about memory and end
          cases, but still some things have no conventional terms.  Hence, I feel it is
          important to provide a consistent nomenclature for use when talking about the
          tape machine library.

        <p>
          In the abstract a tape machine has a <i>tape</i>, an indicator <i>head</i>, and a
          <i>function interface</i>.  

        <p>
          The tape consists of a linear series of at least one <i>cell</i>. Each cell
          contains exactly one <i>object</i>. Here by object we mean some data, and do not
          imply anything more. With the exception of 'subspaces', the structure of this
          object is externally imposed.

          Because cell allocation requires an initialization object, it is not possible to
          have an uninitialized cell. If a machine can not be initialized, it might be
          replaced by ∅. In some cases we provide a meta initialization value as a stub to
          build from, such as a first cell with a symbol indicating the type of sequence
          being used as a tape. Ironically we have found that such tapes are convenient to
          be returned from macros, in other cases we simply call cdr at the end to drop
          the extraneous cell.

          When a tape machine tape has two or more cells, all cells, potentially except for
          two, have two neighbors.  A <i>left neighbor</i> and a <i>right neighbor</i>.  The
          two potentially special cells are called
          <i>leftmost</i>, which has only a right neighbor, and <i>rightmost</i>, which has
          only a left neighbor. The tape may be an abstraction that is maintained through
          function calls, in which case the tape might not have a leftmost or rightmost.

          The <i>leftmost object</i> is the object in the leftmost cell, etc.

          When a tape has one cell, that one cell is both leftmost and rightmost, and it
          has no neighbors.

        <p>
          At any given time the indicator head is <i>on</i> exactly one cell. We say
          <i>indicator</i> head, rather than the more conventional
          <i>read-write</i> head, because reading and writing are part of the function
          interface.  The purpose of the indicator head is to locate a cell.  The object
          in the indicated cell is called the <i>indicated object</i>, the <i>object
            indicated by the head</i>.  

        <p>
          Putting the head on a specific cell is to <i>cue</i> the head.  Three cue
          functions are defined in the library: cue-leftmost, cue-to, and cue-rightmost.
          Cue-to cues the head to the same location that another tape machine that mounts
          the same tape is located at, though having multiple heads on one tape leads to
          hazards when combined with structual operations.  This is discussed in the
          chapter, "Multiple Heads".

        <p>
          Heads either <i>step</i> or are <i>cued</i>.  In contrast objects are said
          to <i>move</i>.  If one says that "a tape machine <i>moved</i>", that means the
          tape machine is an object and it was moved to another cell. This distinction
          becomes particularly important after the introduction of "spaces".

        <p>
          The function interface consists of <i>primitive</i> and <i>derived</i>
          functions.  Primitive functions are those with no generic implementation.  A new
          tape machine may be defined by providing an implementation for the primitive
          functions.  In contrast the derived functions have implementations in terms of
          the primitive functions.  In this library we use CLOS, so the 'functions' we
          refer to here are generally methods. For efficiency purposes a specialization
          may be provided for a derived method. The primitive functions are: r (read), w
          (write), cue-leftmost, heads-on-same-cell, s (step), a (allocate), and d
          (deallocate).  Though we are at version 0.1, and this list might be tweaked.
          There are many derived functions including those for handling subspaces, for
          quantification and repetition, and for compound operations.

        <p>
          In this implementation, tape-machine is a class with two slots.  One slot is
          called, <i>HA</i> which stands for head address, and the other slot is
          called <i>tape</i>.  Should the tape machine be mounted on a sequence, the tape
          slot is set to the sequence, and HA holds the location in the sequence.  For an
          array HA will be the index for the current cell.  For a list HA will be the
          current cons cell. Derived classes make due with just these two slots, which
          assures that we can consistently convert between tape-machine types.

        <p>
          We have two functions for making tape machines, one is <i>tm-mk</i> and the
          other is <i>mount</i>.  <i>tm-mk</i> takes only a sequence and then tries to
          match that up with the best tape machine implementation for the type of
          sequence. Where as <i>mount</i> accepts a tape machine class and an
          initialization value, and then tries to produce an initialized tape machine of
          that class type.  The function <i>unmount</i> accepts a tape machine and
          returns the mounted tape.

        <p>
          Modifications to head location or to the tape contents are said to
          be <i>stateful</i>.  Modifications that add or remove cells from the tape are
          said to be <i>structural</i>.  (Adding cells to the tape is
          called <i>allocation</i>.  Removing cells from the tape is
          called <i>deallocation</i>.)  We know from experience that programs that only
          modify state tend to be simpler than those that modify structure. Yet there
          always seem to be cases, such as gathering results, where structural changes
          are the most convenient type.  Even Scheme allows one to use a cons cell
          to lengthen a list, albeit only from one end.

        <p>
          We use inclusive bounds so we don't need to represent addresses that are outside
          of our address space.  The typical mode is to do some work, and then to step. If
          the machine head is on rightmost, then we do something appropriate.
