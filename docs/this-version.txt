v0.1
Initial release.


v0.5

In version 0.1 tape machines could only be created with intialization data, which lead
programmers to use padding cells when data was not known.  Machines with padding cells are
indistinguishable from this without them, so afterward the programmer had to do mental
accounting of which machines had padding cells and which didn't.

In this version we introduce void and parked tape machine states, so that the user doesn't
have to account for padding cells.  A void machine is one that does not yet have data, so
it can be created even when an initialization value is not known.  A parked machine is one
where the head acts like it is to the left of leftmost, so that production of the
first value to be place on a tape does not require special code.

We have further developed the interval space transform (tm-interval) while taking
advantage of the revised tape machine.  This has lead to a new implementation of
the buffer types (stack and queue).
