v0.7

  1. copies, entangled machines, and destructive operations

    We say that two machines are 'entangled' when they share a tape.  When two machines
    share a tape there can be hazards, for exmample, should one machine delete the cell that
    the head of another machine is on, it breaks the other machine.  Hence, in version 0.1
    we did not support entangled machines.  In version v0.7 we support them, both within a
    single thread, and between threads.

    v0.7 introduces a more sophisticated tape machine model, one where there is a hierarchy
    of machines.

    The parent of the hiearchy is the tape machine.  It supports a shallow copy, where a new
    tape machine is made with a new tape, but does not have an entangled copy, where a copy
    would share the same tape with the original.  It also does not have destructive
    operations.

    Inherited from the tape machine, the 'solo tape machine' also does not support entangled
    copy, but it does support destructive operations. Destructive operations are safe
    because there can only be one head on a given tape.

    Also inherited from the tape machine is the 'nd tape machine', which supports only
    non-destructive operations.  Because this machine only performs non-destrucive
    operations, entangled copy operations are safe, and thus included.

    tape-machine, solo-tape-machine, and nd-tape-machine have no added overhead.  The 'solo
    head' or 'non-destrucive operations only' disciplines are sufficient for making the new
    operations copy operations or destructive operations safe, respectively.  Though it is
    an either-or situation, either allow destructive operations, or have entangled copy, but
    not both.

    The multi-tape-machine is derived in diamond inheritance from solo-tape-machine and
    nd-tape-machine. The multi-tape machine supports both entangled copy operations leading
    to mulitple heads on one tape and destructive operations.  This comes at the expense of
    a new slot in the machine referring to a shared listener list, and the extra operations to
    perform 'entanglement accounting' so as to avoid hazards.

    The threaded-tape machine takes multi-tape one step further and allows that tape
    machines may be shared both within a thread (as per multi-tape-machine), and between
    threads.
