Say tm is a some given tape machine.  Say we call (entanglements tm) 'es'.  es is a
tape machine, though one used in a limited fashion.  We must constrain how it is used
in order to avoid recursive definitions.

It is interesting that the es machine is in fact the same as the older version
0.2 implemenation.  I.e. if there are no cells in the machine, we represent the machine
by null.  If the reference to the machine is non-null, then the machine has at least
one initialized cell.  In this manner (state es) will always be active, and thus we
never invoke state transition code.

Is this necessary?  The state transition code does not necessarily invoke entanglement
accounting, and thus can it not be used without causing a circular definition for es?
